## Introduction
In the past, I found it inconvenient when I didn't notice the reactions used for replies and responses in Discord, so I created a Bot that reacts to reactions and sends notifications. When a user reacts, the Bot mentions the message owner. Please refer to the following [article](https://qiita.com/Pumila/items/cf447c24538e13994a38) for how it works. I have decided to release this Bot (I don't know if there is a demand for it...). Please give it a try.

## Cautions
Please report errors to the developer's Twitter or github.
The hosting service used is "Railway". It has 8GB of memory and 8 CPU cores. I don't think it's a particularly heavy load Bot, but it might become unstable. Please refer to [this](https://qiita.com/Pumila/items/29f26fb349d5592046ae) for information about "Railway".

## Installation
Note: Only those with server administrator privileges can install the Bot.
Click here, login, choose the server you want to install, click [Yes], and then press the authorization button. Check the confirmation screen whether it's a robot or not and the installation is complete.
If you no longer need it, I would appreciate it if you could expel it to reduce the server load.

## Usage
### Description of each slash command
I will explain each slash command of the Bot. If you get an error when executing the slash command, please try executing the command again.

#### Changing the notification channel
You can change the channel to which notifications are sent. The default is the system message channel.

1. Enter "/", click the icon of Reaction Notification-kun, select /set_channel from the command list.
2. Enter the name of the channel you want to be notified and execute. You can also select from the suggested options.
3. If you select a channel where the Bot has no posting authority, or a channel that is not a text channel, you will receive the following warnings. Warning: No permission to post in the channel {new_channel.name}., {new_channel.name} is not a text channel..
4. You will receive a message from the Bot saying Set channel to {new_channel_name}..

## Finally
I had created a Bot that responds to Discord reactions and sends notifications, and while I was thinking of releasing it, I was busy with various things and could not release it. I had the opportunity to release it this time, so please give it a try.
If you like this Bot, I would appreciate your donations for the server maintenance cost.
